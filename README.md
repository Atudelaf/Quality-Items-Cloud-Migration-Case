# Cloud Migration for Quality Items  
*E-commerce Data Infrastructure Modernization by Adrian Tudela*  

## 1. Business Challenge  
**Company:** Quality Items (mid-sized e-commerce retailer)  
**Problem:** Rapid growth overwhelmed their on-premises SQL Server, causing:  
- 🐢 **Performance bottlenecks** (slow website, checkout delays)  
- 🔓 **Security risks** (unencrypted data, no disaster recovery)  
- 📈 **Scalability limits** (couldn't handle peak traffic/data growth)  

**Goal:** Migrate to Azure SQL Database for scalability, security, and cost efficiency  

## 2. Solution & Approach  
### Key Deliverables  
✔ **Phased Migration:**  
1. **Assessment (2 weeks):** Audited existing infrastructure  
2. **Migration (4 weeks):** Moved data to Azure with <1hr downtime  
3. **Optimization (2 weeks):** Automated backups, real-time dashboards  

✔ **Technical Highlights:**  
- 🛠️ **Azure SQL Database:** Auto-scaling, built-in encryption  
- 📜 **GDPR/HIPAA Compliance:** Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- 💰 **Cost Optimization:** Reserved Azure instances (+20% savings)  

### Team & Tools
